This example illustrates the use of structural directives in Angular2.

To run:

- in a cmd window navigate to the root directory Lesson03
- run "npm start". This will open browser
- in the browser use http://localhost:3000/Lesson03

Rows can be added and removed and the DOM will be updated accordingly.
